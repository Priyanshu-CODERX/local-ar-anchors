# Local Augmented Reality Anchors

As ARCoreâ€™s environmental understanding updates throughout an AR experience, virtual objects can appear to drift away from where they were placed. This can impact your app's realism and user experience.
Anchors ensure that objects appear to stay at the same position and orientation in space, helping you maintain the illusion of virtual objects placed in the real world.
